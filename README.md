YouLoop
=======

Chrome extension to put YouTube videos on repeat. It will show as a Chrome PageAction on YouTube pages. A simple click will start looping (and restart, if necessary) the video.

I decided to implement this after seeing the other Chrome extensions for looping YouTube videos. All of them were kind of messy and still supported the old and deprecated Flash Player. YouLoop only works with the new HTML5 video player. Flash Player, please die!

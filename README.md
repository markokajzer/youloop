YouLoop
=======

Chrome extension to put YouTube videos on repeat. When visiting a YouTube video, it will show on the far right of the address bar. A simple click start looping the video (and restart it if necessary).

I decided to implement this extension after looking into the code of some others qualified for the same task. All of them were kind of messy and still supported the old and deprecated Flash Player, which even Adobe (its creators) want removed. Therefore, I just drop support for Flash, YouLoop only works with the new HTML5 video player.
